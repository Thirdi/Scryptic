The `sfEmailPlugin` is a symfony plugin that allows to debug emails deliverability in development mode. All the emails are stored as the plain text 
files into /log/mail/ folder (by default). And you will be able to browse/view them via sfEmail module.
This could be really helpfull for the cases when you are testing confirmation link integrated in emails, user registration information and don't have
a way to use real deliverability.
