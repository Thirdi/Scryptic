To install the plugin use:
{{{
symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfAjaxUploaderPlugin
}}}

== Settings ==

enable module: ajaxUploader

include helper: AjaxUploader

create filter using class: AjaxUploaderFilter

include js: /sfAjaxUploaderPlugin/js/ajaxUploader

== Using the plugin ==

Use helper '''input_ajaxsafe_file_tag''' in place of input_file_tag.
Make call to '''myAjaxUploader()''' BEFORE the AJAX request.
When the request is done you will have the filepath of the loaded file in your request parameters. The file is already moved to your upload area.

Example using '''form_remote_tag''' with the AJAX uploader:

{{{
<?php 
  // the form
  echo form_remote_tag(array(
    'before'   => 'myAjaxUploader()',
    'update'   => 'item_list',
    'url'      => 'item/add',
  ));
  // the file input field
  echo input_ajaxsafe_file_tag('name');
?>
}}}

In the action the request parameter '''name''' will be populated with the filepath to the uploaded file.
